# Feedback Autowriter — runbook

Feature page: [`features/feedback-autowriter.md`](../features/feedback-autowriter.md). CLI:
`npx tsx --tsconfig scripts/tsconfig.json scripts/autowrite-online-feedback.ts …` (run from the repo root with a
`.env.local` holding `DATABASE_URL`, `WISE_*`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

## 1. One-time setup

1. **Migration 0097** on production Neon (`DATABASE_URL=… npm run db:migrate`). It seeds the control row in
   `shadow` mode.
2. **Vercel production env** (redeploy after changing):
   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | a dedicated key with a credit limit |
   | `FEEDBACK_AUTOWRITER_ENABLED` | `true` (anything else: cron and webhook do nothing) |
   | `FEEDBACK_AUTOWRITER_ALERT_EMAILS` | comma-separated recipients of the held-class digest |
   | `WISE_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` | `true` (otherwise the receiver acknowledges and ignores) |
   | `WISE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | the auth key Wise shows for the BGScheduler webhook |
   | `WISE_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER` | only if Wise's header is not `authorization` |
3. **Wise → Institute Settings → Developer options → Webhooks → Add Webhook.** Never edit the existing
   subscription (it feeds a Google Apps Script). URL `https://bgscheduler.vercel.app/api/wise/webhook`,
   events `MeetingEndedEvent`, `AttendanceComputedEvent` and `RecordingCompletedEvent`. Send a test: if it is refused, Vercel logs
   `[wise-webhook] unauthorized delivery; header names: …` — set `WISE_WEBHOOK_AUTH_HEADER` to the right one.
   Confirm read-only with `GET /institutes/{id}/webhooks` that both subscriptions exist and the original is unchanged.

## 2. Modes and switches (take effect immediately — no redeploy)

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--status` | show mode, halt, disabled tutors, roster |
| `--mode=shadow --actor=<email>` | draft and judge, never POST (drafts land in `would_submit`) |
| `--mode=live --actor=<email>` | POST allowed; shadow drafts still before their deadline are re-queued |
| `--mode=off --actor=<email>` | do nothing |
| `--pause --reason="…" --actor=<email>` | global halt: no POSTs until resumed |
| `--resume --actor=<email>` | clear the halt (check why it halted first) |
| `--tutor-off=<wiseUserId>` / `--tutor-on=…` | per-tutor switch |
| `--sweep` / `--process=<wiseSessionId>` | run the same guarded path by hand |

Outer gates needing a redeploy: `FEEDBACK_AUTOWRITER_ENABLED`, `WISE_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED`. Preview deployments never POST.

Which switch in an incident: `--pause` (or mode `off`) stops all drafting and posting at once and **keeps
reconciling** POSTs already made, emailing their alerts. `FEEDBACK_AUTOWRITER_ENABLED=false` stops everything,
reconciliation included — rows in `posting`/`awaiting_event` then wait, visible on the dashboard, until it is
turned back on. Prefer `--pause` unless the code itself must not run.

The owner has the same mode, pause/resume and per-tutor switches on the dashboard at `/feedback-autowriter`.

## 3. Rollout checklist

1. Shadow for 2–3 days. Exit criteria:
   - every `would_submit` draft reviewed next to what the tutor wrote themselves;
   - `feedback_autowriter_calls`: 100% of GLM calls with `provider = 'Together'`;
   - gate reasons per tutor look right (`select wise_teacher_user_id, state, reason, count(*) from feedback_autowriter_sessions group by 1,2,3`);
   - webhook deliveries arriving (`select event_name, count(*) from wise_webhook_events group by 1`) and their
     session ids parsed (`wise_session_id is not null`).
2. Same hour: `--mode=live` and message the tutors:
   Tutors on the roster: Kevin, Gift, Ek, Peat, Mimi.
   > From today BGScheduler writes the Wise feedback for your **online one-to-one** classes from the Zoom
   > summary, in English. Offline and group classes are still yours. You can't edit it in Wise afterwards — ask an
   > admin. If an online class still shows blank feedback 3 hours after it ends, tell an admin.
3. First live POST per tutor: state `verified`, Wise shows the text, Class Feedback shows it `on_time`, the
   student's credit history has one entry for the class.

## 4. When it halts

`--status` (or the dashboard banner) shows `haltReason`; several reasons are joined with `| then:` — read all of
them, resuming clears every one. The class named there may have: a POST whose outcome is unclear, a read-back that
did not match, a second credit entry, a tutor/admin save between the fresh read and the POST (possible overwrite),
or a POST that could not be verified for 2 hours. Open the class in Wise (link in the alert email), fix it by hand
if needed (feedback text, credits), then `--resume`.
While halted nothing is drafted (no model calls); rows still expire with alerts so a person can write them.
The cron reports `ok:false` (503) while halted, so the cron watchdog emails admins.

A POST whose read-back failed stays `posting` and blocks every other POST (one in flight at a time) until the
sweep reconciles it, 6+ minutes later; meanwhile no session is drafted (no model calls). If Wise reads keep
failing, Data Health shows the sweep's infrastructure errors; after 2 hours the row becomes `verify_failed` and the
autowriter halts.

## 5. Alerts

One digest per sweep to `FEEDBACK_AUTOWRITER_ALERT_EMAILS` for classes that need a person: held (draft failed
checks, absence, form/billing drift), expired, no summary 3 h after class, and any halt-causing outcome.
In `shadow` (and `off`) only the halt-causing outcomes are emailed; draft alerts stay on the dashboard.
A switched-off tutor's classes are handed back to them silently when they reach the deadline window.
Nightly tutor reminders are separate (Class Feedback).
